# EV-TRON

EV-TRON is a Tron-inspired, 16-bit educational racing game about Electric Vehicles (EVs). Race through a neon digital highway, collect energy, and test your knowledge of EVs while balancing the risks of running out of charge or overheating your battery.

## Gameplay Overview

EV-Tron has a top-down racing feel. The player must control their EV bike while the world scrolls beneath them. The player must also keep their battery charged within a certain range; too much energy can mean overheating, but too little energy will result in a game over.
There will be quick EV trivia questions that can be activated by collecting glowing boxes, which also serve as buff / debuffs depending on whether the player answers correctly or not.
The player can play Endless Mode to aim for the longest run possible, or Challenge Mode where they will attempt to reach the end and unlock a final trivia gate.

## Features

- Dynamic difficulty that ramps up the further the player goes
- Trivia questions that teach EV facts in a fun and interactive way
- Buffs and debuffs tied to EV concepts like battery efficiency, overheating, and energy drain

## Educational Goal

EV-TRON is about learning. Through fast-paced gameplay and trivia challenges, players can discover:
- How EV batteries behave in real life
- The environmental impact of EVs
- Fun facts that break down myths and highlight EV benefits

## Tech (Planned)
- Engine: Unity (2D)
- Art: Custom pixel art inspired by retro arcades and Tron aesthetics
- Music: Retro synthwave soundtrack
